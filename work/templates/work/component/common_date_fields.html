                    original {{ name }}, then enter the day here as '8' not '18'.

                    However, please do adjust the year for {{ name }}s dated using the form of Julian calendar
                    where the New Year began on 25th March. For example, 8th January 1659/60 should be
                    entered as 8-Jan-1660.
